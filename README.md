# Heat-Map Table

Work in Progress!

A Heat Map is a chart that uses colour (3-Color scales) to visualize a two-dimensional matrix of values. Since pivot tables make the creation of two-dimensional output so easy the heat map is the perfect tool for visualizing a pivot table.

Color Scale
------------------------------
Color Scales in Microsoft Excel make it very easy to visualize values in a range of cells. The shade of the color represents the value in the cell.

Result:

Explanation: by default, for 3-Color scales, Excel calculates the 50th percentile (also known as median, middle value or midpoint). The cell that holds the minimum value (9) is colored red. The cell that holds the median (36) is colored yellow, and the cell that holds the maximum value (80) is colored green. All other cells are colored proportionally.

##### Green-Yellow-Red (GYR) Color Scale

*Green*  :: R = 243; B = 81; G = 88 | *Yellow* :: R = 254 ; B = 233; G = 144 | *Red* :: R = 84; B = 180; G = 104

> use color-scale code `GYR`

##### Red-Yellow-Green (RYG) Color Scale

*Red*  :: R = 84; B = 180; G = 104 | *Yellow* :: R = 254 ; B = 233; G = 144 | *Green* :: R = 243; B = 81; G = 88

> use color-scale code `RYG`


##### Green-White-Red (GWR) Color Scale

*Green* :: R = 243; B = 81; G = 88 | *White* :: R = 256 ; B = 256; G = 256 | *Red*  :: R = 84; B = 180; G = 104

> use color-scale code `GWR`

##### Red-White-Green (RWG) Color Scale


##### Blue-White-Red (BWR) Color Scale


##### Red-White-Blue (RWB) Color Scale
